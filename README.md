# TikTok Bans
TikTok is everywhere. I have it. My friends have it. Even my dad has it (he sends me lots of TikToks of cats and #fail compilations). But in the face of data privacy issues and multiple lawsuits against ByteDance (TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company), American politicians, schools, parents, and TikTokers continue to debate bans of the app.

## Article 1
In _NPR_'s [Can TikTok be trusted with users' data?](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/30/1108843837/can-tiktok-be-trusted-with-users-data), host Rachel Martin discusses data privacy with FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr. Carr begins by acknowledging that most Americans don't see the threat that TikTok faces to their data privacy because they only see TikTok as "just an app for sharing funny videos or memes". However, Carr believes that there is a danger to TikTok in that it can access humongous amounts of users' data and possibly report it to the Chinese government because ByteDance is "beholden to the CCP".

Because of this threat to data privacy, Carr called on Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores in June of 2022. Google and Apple have not removed TikTok because the FCC doesn't have the jurisdiction to force them to. Personally, I disagree with Carr because I think that it would be very difficult for giants like Google and Apple to do something like that and it would make a lot of Americans angry. Additionally, having Google and Apple remove the app from their stores just adds another party to the fight between the US government, ByteDance, and China. However, I agree with Carr in that the majority of American TikTok users don't see the data privacy issues that plague their (and mine, I'm not gonna pretend to be above it because I _do_ in fact use TikTok) favorite app.

## Article 2
Contrastingly, in Shira Ovide's _Wahington Post_ op-ed , [Those government TikTok 'bans' hardly ban anything](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/23/tiktok-china-ban/), Ovide takes a more pessimistic view on TikTok bans. She asserts that politicians have shifted the issue of TikTok user's privacy's focus from a data-driven issue to a political issue. Much of this political shift has to do with TikTok being owned by Chinese-based company ByteDance. The US government fears that, through TikTok, Americans' data could be given to the Chinese government. However, even after multiple attempts to ban the app, Americans still use (and love) Tiktok.

Ovide further critiques the government for not following through on their promises to keep American's privacy safe, writing that our current situation "may be the worst of two worlds: TikTok is neither banned nor controlled." Many of the bans that have been placed on TikTok don't do much and only pertain to government workers and some public universities. Because of this, Ovide explains that we are "stuck" and that big changes in TikTok's data privacy can only be made through stronger prevention of cyberattacks from China and more transparency from algorithm-dependent companies. Ovide is right, we need something to curb the power of TikTok. But it will be difficult to create a ban that satisfies everyone. Almost everyone I know has TikTok, and it's difficult to imagine that they'd be happy and/or willing to let it go. Even if these bans do come to fruition, the addictiveness of the app will make it very difficult for users to let go of it.
